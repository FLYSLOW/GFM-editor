# GFM-editor

It's hard to find a markdown editor which is fully compatible with [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). Why not just use the one provided by Github? Good idea!

Bookmark this url: `https://github.com/ZekeLu/GFM-editor/edit/master/editor.md`. Whenever you want to edit a markdown file, open this bookmark and you will get an excellent markdown editor.

## Note

It's nothing more than a markdown file hosted in a Github repository. Here is the limitations come with it:

1. You have to connect to network to use the editor;
2. You should create a markdown file in your own repository so that you get the permission to edit it;
3. Most of the time, you don't want to **Commit Changes** to this file.
4. Don't preview confidential content because it will send what you input to the server to parse it.
